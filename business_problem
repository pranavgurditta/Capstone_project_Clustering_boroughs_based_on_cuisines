Problem statement: Suppose a company wants to know which boroughs of Canada have the same type/cuisines of restaurants so that
it can know the number of types of stores of raw food it should open in the whole of Canada.
For example, if a borough in Canada is a part of cluster that offers Chinese and Japanese food the company would open a store
in that area and all the areas in that cluster that offer raw food material of Chinese and Japanese dishes.


Benefits of solving this:
This would help the restaurants also as it would bring down the transportation costs of raw food items and hence provide cheaper
food to the customers.
The company can gain a lot of profit by becoming the nearest seller as restaurants would need these items everyday.
The company can also filter which raw materials to send to a store on a daily basis.
